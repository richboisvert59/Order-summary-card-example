## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I will keep working on Grid templating and developemnt for responsive design. At this stage I want to become completely comfortable creating with HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS resource](https://cssgrid.io/) - I discovered this free course on CSS on MDN site, Mozilla Firefox who has sponsored Wes Bos to create this course and offer it up for free. I found it useful with visualizing and understanding CSS Grid
